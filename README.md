# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). 

This is the fourth challenge I've done.

*Note that I did not have the figma/sketch file to get exact pixels, colors or styles. I did make deviations from the style-guide.md when they did not match the final design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flex
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This chanllege was very diffcult for me initally. I tried my own using flexbox and simple code for the accordion but items where not aligning correctly. Another diffcult point was getting the images right, I attempted to used absolute and relative positions but items would get knocked around when resizing the page or just not attaching to what I want. 
I started to research how other coders did the challenge and there were many different solutions and some did not function very well.
the code that I pulled from (see useful resources) has the best finished product. In this example I got introduced to grid, clamp, picture html element



### Continued development

This project made me realize I need to get more comforable with grid, transition and ways to make responsive styles. 


### Useful resources

- [Seer Studio Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZGpEHgOO8&t=760s) - I based my code off of this video.
- [Clamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo) - This video explained clamp that the above coder used.
- [CSS Grid by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This gave me a good introduction to grid, sine I've only ever been exposed to Flexbox.
- [A complete guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped full in the blanks. Seer Studio used some very advance grid techniques and this article helped me understand the code.
